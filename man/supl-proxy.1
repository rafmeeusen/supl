.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsupl-proxy\fP sets up a proxy and displays SUPL / RRLP traffic
between the client and real SUPL server. It shows GPS assistance data,
such as almanac and ephemeris, and SUPL/RRLP messages received from
the server.

To use it, you must direct your client (e.g. mobile phone) to use your
proxy server as its SUPL server. In Nokia N95 this is in Tool ->
Settings -> General -> Positioning -> Postioning server. In Nokia N900
such setting is also availabe in the settings application.

You must also install a SSL root certificate to the phone. The root
certificate must be set as trusted certificate in the phone. In N95
just set all uses as trusted (in the certificate manager). In N900 you
must use command line tool \fBcmcli\fP (available in
maemosec-certman-tools package) and install the root certificate into
common-ca domain.

The proxy server must be given a server sertificate (signed by the
root certificate) and private key.
